Replace the # YOUR CODE HERE markers below with
code that will calculate the correct values for
difference, product, and average. Complete the
print statements to output correctly formatted  
results.

    # Assign values to the variables below to calculate the difference, product, and average of the values in x and y.
    difference = # YOUR CODE HERE
    product = # YOUR CODE HERE
    average = # YOUR CODE HERE

    # Replace the # YOUR CODE HERE text in the statement below so that the statement will print
    # The difference between x and y is difference.
    # where x, y, and difference are replaced with the values stored in the corresponding variables.    
    print (f'# YOUR CODE HERE')
    # Write a statement to print the product of x and y.
    # Write a statement to print the average of x and y. Make sure this prints 7.5!
